# Python-Interactive-Menu

## Objective
This interactive menu was done as a final project for a CS 115 course. The task was to create a menu-based Python program that enables users to interact with several tools: a white blood cell percentage calculator, a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, and a student score inquiry tool. The task reinforced basic programming concepts like conditionals, loops, lists, dictionaries, functions, and input validation.

### Skills Learned
- Creating interactive console menu-based applications
- User input validation
- Using loops, if/else statements, and dictionary data types
- Using randomization for gameplay logic
- Percentages calculation and display with formatted output
- Splitting string inputs and converting data types for filtering based on range

### Tools Used
- Python (developed in Thonny IDE)
- Built-in random module for generating Rock-Paper-Scissors outcomes
- Standard input/output for interacting with the user
- Lists and dictionaries to store and manage game data

### Steps
1. White Blood Cell Percentage Checker
Allows the user to input a string of white blood cell types using characters "N", "L", or "M". The program then calculates and displays the percentage breakdown of Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, and Monocytes.

2. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
A fun and replayable game where the user plays against the computer. The game accepts input, randomly selects the computerâ€™s move, and evaluates the winner.

3. Student Score Lookup
The user can enter a score range (e.g., 50 80), and the program lists student IDs and scores that fall within that range using a predefined dictionary.

4. Exit
Simple option that ends the session and prints a goodbye message.
